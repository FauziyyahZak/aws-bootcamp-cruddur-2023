# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Tasks I have completed.
- I have successfully created an IAM user in my AWS account, and enabled MFA for said user.

- I have installed AWS CLI on gitpod. A commit regarding this has been duly made in my repo. The command is saved so that it is automatically run each time I open a workspace.

- I have generated AWS credentials for my user and had that saved using the newly learnt gp env command.


- I have set up budgets and billing alarms.

- [I also was able to launch Cloudshell, and connected my user using the generated credentials.](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnV2r9svs5t9jWn4BGj8vlEkM37G?e=3l5qSl)
