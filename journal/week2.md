# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
- As a user of codespaces, since I have run out Gitpod credits, I have saved my tokens and secrets in the Codespaces secret manager tab.
- ![Secrets manager](Materials/Secrets manager.png)
- I have also commented out env vars config that are specifically for Gitpod and replaced with those of Codespaces.

- I have instrumented Honeycomb with OTEL in my application.

- I have also experimented the instrumentation of AWS Xray, but disabled it for spend consideration.

- I have configured custom logger to send logs to cloudwatch.
- [Cloudwatch log](Materials/Cloudwatch log.png)
- I have integrated rollbar.

- Copying codes from the resources to Codespaces somehow messes up my indentations, but I'm able to resolve them. I still currently have some lines under some of my codes indicating errors, but these are not affecting the functionality of my app.
